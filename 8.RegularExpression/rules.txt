1. /string/  -> for strings

2. /^expressions$/
    /^ -> open tag to write regular expressions
    $/ -> close tag

3. [] -> group of char sets

    ex:  [abcdef]  -> input should match atleast single occurrence of any give characters

         [a-z] ->  group of lowercase characters from a to z
         [A-Z] ->           uppercase
         [0-9] -> group of decimal numbers 
          [a-zA-Z]  or [a-z0-9] or [A-Z0-9] or [a-zA-Z0-9] or  [D-S]
